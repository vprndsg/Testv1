# Psychedelic Simon Says

This project hosts a mobile-optimized "Simon Says" game with a psychedelic twist. The entire screen is a dynamic play board featuring four morphing lava-lamp style pads. Each round the pads light up in a sequence with ambient tones and you repeat the pattern by tapping them in order.
